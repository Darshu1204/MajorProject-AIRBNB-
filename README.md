The goal of this project is to develop a basic clone of the Airbnb website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This clone will allow users to browse listings, create accounts, and manage their bookings, offering a simplified experience similar to that of Airbnb.

Objectives :-
1.User Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionality.
2.Listing Management: Allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) property listings. 
3.Search and Filter: Enable users to search for listings based on location, price, and other criteria.

Features User Authentication:-

-Registration and login forms.
-Property Listings:A homepage displaying available listings with images, descriptions, and prices. Individual listing pages with detailed information and booking options. 
-CRUD Operations:Allow users to create new listings by filling out a form with property details. Enable users to edit or delete their own listings.

Future Enhancements:-
Implement a rating and review system for users to provide feedback on listings.
Integrate a payment gateway for secure transactions. 
Add user profiles for managing bookings and viewing past listings.


Conclusion :-This project will provide a hands-on opportunity to develop a full-stack web application using the MERN stack, simulating a real-world application like Airbnb. It will help improve skills in web development, user experience design, and database management.
